The classes are drawn from the urban sound taxonomy. For a detailed description of the dataset and how it was compiled please refer to our paper.
All excerpts are taken from field recordings uploaded to www.freesound.org. The files are pre-sorted into ten folds (folders named fold1-fold10) to help in the reproduction of and comparison with the automatic classification results reported in the article above.

In addition to the sound excerpts, a CSV file containing metadata about each excerpt is also provided.
